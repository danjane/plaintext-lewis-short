# Plain text Lewis & Short CSV

## What?

Two plain text versions of *A Latin Dictionary* edited by Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short. These files are based on the XML version that [the Perseus Digital Library][perseus] has [made available under a Creative-Commons license][lexica]. The only difference between the two files is that one replaces straight quotes with curly quotes. (The text already contains other unicode features, so it seemed worth doing.)

## Why?

This dictionary is widely available online in various ebook formats and as XML, but not as plain text as far as I know. Plain text is much easier to work with than these other formats. In addition, the PerseusDL XML file leaves the Greek in [beta code][beta] format.

My motivation is to use this version of Lewis and Short to create tools to help myself and other teachers create glossaries for students. (As those tools develop, I'll put a link here.) However, I hope that other people find these files useful for lots of other projects. See below for license.

## How?

I used [a tool provided by PerseusDL][tei-conversion-tools] to transform the beta code in the XML file into unicode Greek and a small set of `sed` commands to transform all of the remaining character entities into unicode. (E.g., `&amacr;` becomes 'ƒÅ'.) Finally a Python script extracted the content from the XML. (I've included the `sed` and Python scripts in case anyone wants to adapt or improve those.)
